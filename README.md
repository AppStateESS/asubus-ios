AsUBus iPhone Source
========

This is the complete iOS source for AsUBus. It may look like 
a mess, and it may seem like a mess, but that is becaue it is
totally a mess. Unfortunately, XCode does "fake" folders for 
your code, so even though the mess of source files in /AsUBus 0.2
are all unorganized, they are actually neatly organized on my system.

Oh and the 0.2 is a looooong story, but it is so engrained in the 
code that taking it out is a bitch and I'm lazy.
